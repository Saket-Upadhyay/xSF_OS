Footnote: 
Currently, I am trying to get a clear and deep understanding of Computer Architecture, Linux Kernel, Memory Management and other core topics.
(I am learning from different books, youtube videos, and opensource projects, and reflecting all this in my project.)

End goals for xSFOS are -

- [ ] To create well-structured documentation and proper releases on Git so that anyone can trace my steps and learn the same concepts.
- [ ] Ultimately converting this into a very basic but strong academic tool to aid the teaching of these somewhat difficult to understand, but crucial concepts.

If that sounds good to you, feel free to track the project or collaborate ^\_^
